# forest_fire_prediction
The main aim of the project is to predict the forest fire based on some attributes using machine learning techniques.
The goal of this project is to predict forest fires using machine learning algorithms. This project uses Random forest regressor to provide better accuracy.
The forst fire exploration dataset will be divided into training data and test data. The training data is fed into the model for supervised learning.
